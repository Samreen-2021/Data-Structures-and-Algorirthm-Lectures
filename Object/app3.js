//Suppose you have an array of objects:

	let books = [
        {name: 'The Lean Startup',
			topics: ['entrepreneurship','startups'],
		},
		{
			name: 'War and Peace',
			topics: ['peace', 'politics'],
		}];
        console.log(books[0].name);
        console.log(books[1].name);

// Now you need to print the name and topics separately, how would you do that?
